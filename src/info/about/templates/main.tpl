    <p>The iRecord Land App has been developed for gathering information about
      land use and soils. You might take soil for granted but our capacity to feed
      ourselves depends upon maintaining it in a healthy state.
     </p>
     <p>The aims are two-fold: to confirm observations made by satellites and to
       watch out for indications of soil degradation on the ground. Anyone may assist
       in this work by using this mobile app.
